				<P>Mutillidae implements vulnerabilities from the OWASP Top 10 2013, 2010 and 2007 in PHP. Additionally
					vulnerabilities from the SANS Top 25 Programming Errors and select information disclosure
					vulnerabilities have been added on various pages.</P>


				<H3>Optional Configuration</h3>
				<p>Instructional videos are available to help set up an HTTPS TLS certificate or Apache virtual hosts
				</p>

				<h3>
					Top Menu Bar
				</h3>

				<ul>
					<li>Home: Takes user to Home page</li>
					<li>Login/Register: Takes user to Login page</li>
					<li>Toggle Hints: Shows or hides the Hints on vulnerable pages</li>
					<li>Toggle Security: Changes the security level between insecure, client-side security and secure
					</li>
					<li>Enforce TLS: When enforced, Mutillidae automatically redirects all HTTP requests to HTTPS</li>
					<li>Reset DB: Drops and rebuilds all database tables and resets the project</li>
					<li>View Log: Takes the user to view the log</li>
					<li>View Captured Data: Takes the user to the view the captured data</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Left Menu Bar</h3>
				<p>
					The menu on the left is organized by category then vulnerability. Some vulnerabilities will be in
					more
					than one category as there is overlap between categories. Each page in Mutillidae will expose
					multiple
					vulnerabilities. Some pages have half a dozen and/or multiple critical vulnerabilities on the same
					page.
					The page will appear in the menu under each vulnerability.
				</p>

				<p>A listing of vulnerabilities is available in menu under documentation or by clicking here.</p>

				<h3>Videos</h3>

				<p>
					The videos on the Webpwnized YouTube Channel are likely to be a some assistance. Videos cover
					installation, using tools like Burp-Suite and exploits for various vulnerabilities.
				</p>

				<h3>Page Hints</h3>
				<p>
					Besides the menus, this will be the most important feature for newcomers. To enable hints, toggle
					the
					"Show Hints" button (top menu bar). A hints section will appear IF the page contains
					vulnerabilities.
					The Hints are "smart" showing only those hints that will help on the particular page.
				</p>


				<h3>Security Modes</h3>
				<p>
					Mutillidae currently has three modes: completely insecure, client-side security and secure. In
					insecure
					and client-side mode, the pages are vulnerable to at least the topic they fall under in the menu.
					Note
					that client-side security mode is just as vulnerable as insecure mode, but JavaScript validation or
					HTML
					controls make exploits somewhat more difficult.
				</p>
				<p>
					In secure mode, Mutillidae attempts to protect the pages with server side scripts. Also, hints are
					disabled.
				</p>
				<p>The mode can be changed using the "Toggle Security" button on the top menu bar.</p>


				<h3>"Help Me" Button</h3>
				<p>
					The "Help Me" button provides a basic description of the vulnerabilities on the page for which the user
					should try exploits. Use this button to get a quick list of issues. Use the Hints to see more details.
				</p>


				<h3>Just give me the exploit</h3>
				<p>
					Hints will typically provide some exploits. Known exploits that are used in testing Mutillidae are
					located in /documentation/mutillidae-test-scripts.txt. There is some documentation for each exploit
					which explains usage and location.
				</p>


				<h3>Be Careful</h3>
				<p>
					Mutillidae is a "live" system. The vulnerabilities are real rather than emulated. This eliminates
					the
					frustration of having to "know what the author wants". Because of this, there are likely
					undocumented
					vulnerabilities. Also, this project endangers any machine on which it runs. Best practice is to run
					Mutillidae in a virtual machine isolated from the network which is only booted when using
					Mutillidae.
					Every effort has been made to make Mutillidae ables run entirely off-line.
				</p>


				<h3>Whitepaper</h3>
				<p>A project whitepaper is available to explain the features of Mutillidae and suggested use-cases.</p>
